# Dental Care

## Overview 

This project is designed to highlight the services of a fictional Dental Practice.
Using HTML & CSS the aim is to provide an overview of the practice, the services on offer and testimonials from existing customers.
The purpose of the web page is to attract new customers and provide an efficient website for existing customers to request new appointments.


## UX 

### Project Goals

The main goal of Dental Care is to provide an informative and concise site for prospective customers who are looking for a reliable local dentist. The site is also designed to provide a way for existing customers to request an appointment for various dental services remotely.
Dental Care there is aimed at two main audiences: New and/or Existing Customers.

#### New Customer goals are:

- Informative Site.
- Comprehensive Services.
- Clearly Presented Information.
- Evidence of Customer Satisfaction.
- Clear Form to provide contact details.

#### Existing Customer goals are:

- Have a site that is intuitive to navigate.
- Quick review of existing services available.
- Hassle free ability to request an appointment.

#### Dental Care addresses these goals by:

- Following a clearly defined step-by-step design philosophy from initial concept right through to deployment.
- Having visual queues to site specific information.
- Clear indication on highlighted/clickable links.
- A professional site where information is being presented in a concise manner.
- Uniform design across the site.
- Being a site that is presented in a manner consistant with a clinical/healthcare look and feel.

#### Developer and Business Goals

- Development of a site that is visually consistent with customer expectations of a Dental/Clinical setting.
- Encourage prospective and existing customers to engage with the business.
- Display of ability to build a site using HTML, CSS & Bootstrap.
- Ensure that the site is fully responsive using the mobile-first design philosophy.
- Customising technologies used to give the site a unique feel.

2. Need to be able to quickly review the dental services available to see if they are appropriate to my needs.
3. Want to be able to view the site across multiple devices e.g. while not at home on desktop or laptop.
4. Expect to have visual cues while navigating the site.

### Design Choices

The overall feel of the site is one designed to present both professionally and provide a clinical feel. As a result the design choices are detailed below:

#### Fonts

The main font used is Roboto this font family was chosen for its readability across desktop and mobile devices.

The secondary font is sans serif and this is used as a generic font where Roboto is not available.

#### Icons 

- These icons were used for their relatability to the corresponding headings so they can be universally understood.

#### Colours

- The colours chosen are of a pale turqouise colour on grey for the navigation bar, text and links/buttons. These were chosen as they contrast well and are consistent with providing a clinical feeling.

#### Styling

- Images, links and buttons were rounded to give a softer overall presentation as opposed to sharp edges.

#### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq as part of the planning process.
