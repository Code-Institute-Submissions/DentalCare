### Design Choices

The overall feel of the site is one designed to present both professionally and provide a clinical feel. As a result the design choices are detailed below:

#### Fonts

The main font used is Noto Sans MS this font family was chosen for its readability and friendlyness where UIs are concerned.

The secondary font is Roboto and this is used as a clean alternative to Noto which shares the same properties of readability.

#### Icons 

- These icons used were for their relatability to the corresponding headings so they can be universally understood.

#### Colours

- The colours chosen are of an pale torqouise color on grey for the nav bar, text and links/buttons. These were chosen as they contrast well and are consistent with providing a clinical feeling.

#### Styling

- Images, links and buttons were rounded to give a softer overall presentation as opposed to sharp edges.

#### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq as part of the planning process.
