The overall feel of the site is one designed to present both professionally and provide a clinical feel. As a result the design choices are detailed below:

#### Fonts

The main font used is Roboto this font family was chosen for its readability across desktop and mobile devices.

The secondary font is sans serif and this is used as a generic font where Roboto is not available.

#### Icons 

- These icons used were for their relatability to the corresponding headings so they can be universally understood.

#### Colours

- The colours chosen are of an pale torqouise color on grey for the nav bar, text and links/buttons. These were chosen as they contrast well and are consistent with providing a clinical feeling.

#### Styling

- Images, links and buttons were rounded to give a softer overall presentation as opposed to sharp edges.

#### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq as part of the planning process.
